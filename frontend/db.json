      "about": "Thekkady is a small area within the Idukki district of Kerala and is known for the multiple places of tourist interest within the region. Periyar National Park and Periyar Tiger Reserve are one of the major tourist attractions in Thekkady. With a total area of over 770 square km, of which around 360 square kilometers are evergreen forest, Periyar National Park provides a lot of opportunities for exploration, nature rambling, and wildlife viewing. Some of the species that inhabit the area are elephants, sambar, tigers, gaur or Indian bison, langurs, and macaques. Apart from the reserve, there are other attractions close by such as the Mangala Devi Kannagi Temple, the Cardamom Hills, Chellar Kovil waterfalls and many others. Thekkady is close to the Western Ghats, and thus there are many picturesque areas around it which can be visited directly for basking in the beauty of the hills. It also provides great opportunities for treks and hikes through its many misty hills. The Periyar river flows through the park, and the Mullaperiyar Dam creates a reservoir on one end of it. This area, thus also provides excellent panoramic views of the river as well as of the tank."
